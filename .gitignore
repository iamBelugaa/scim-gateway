# Compiled binaries (relative to the package)
# For example, if your main package is in the root, ignore the binary name
# Add your specific BINARY_NAME here if it's different or in a subdirectory
# Example based on the Makefile:
dist
# If your binary is generated elsewhere, add its path, e.g.:
bin/

# Output directory for cross-compiled binaries from the Makefile
dist/
